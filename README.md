This is my first Python "project." I mainly know Java, but I have been trying to learn Python and getting along well with most of its libraries.

This program is just a test of a password generator with a very basic graphical interface. I know its not the cleanest or most efficient code, but I made it just to get familiar with the language. However, any recommendations or tips for learning are always welcome. :)
